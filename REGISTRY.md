# Component Registry

Every component that exists, is planned, or is off limits. Check this before building anything (RULEBOOK §4 step 1). Update this file whenever a component is created, its status changes, or its variant count changes.

Status values: `production` (built, documented, safe to reuse or extend), `do-not-use` (exists in Figma but flagged not ready), `planned` (named as an intended atom or molecule, not built).

| Toggle | do-not-use | Toggle | Size x Value x State | 8 | COMPONENT-RULES.md § Toggle; DESIGN.md § Toggle; Documentation frame on the Toggle page (test build, node 1729:82, fully auto-layout + token-bound; awaiting Shashwat's review) |
